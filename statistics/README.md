# README
Results from running `JobForStatisticalSimulation`, with its output captured in the three CSV files (when run with a particular bucket size). Each CSV file notes how often the stash size (root bucket size) reached a certain number. The plot graphs a given stash size against the inverse log2 of how often that stash size was exceeded. Each line is approximately straight, supporting the paper's argument that the overflow probability decreases exponentially as the allotted stash size (root bucket size) increases.
